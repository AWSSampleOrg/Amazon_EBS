# [What’s the Difference Between Throughput and Latency?](https://aws.amazon.com/compare/the-difference-between-throughput-and-latency/)

## Bandwidth

```
Bandwidth represents the total volume of data that you can transfer over a network. Your total bandwidth refers to the theoretical maximum amount of data that you could transfer over a network. You measure it in megabytes per second (MBps). You can think of bandwidth as the theoretical maximum throughput of your network.

Bandwidth is how much data you can transfer, while throughput is the actual amount of data you transmit in any given moment based on real-world network limitations. A high bandwidth does not guarantee speed or a good network performance, but a higher bandwidth leads to higher throughput.
